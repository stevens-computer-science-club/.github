# Welcome to the Stevens Computer Science Club!

The Stevens Institute of Technology Computer Science Club (**SCSC**) is a student organization dedicated to bringing students together, and we welcome everyone from total novices to industry experts! We host weekly meetings that include workshops, competitions, and games, and we facilitate industry panels, Hackathons, collaborations with the Computer Science department and other clubs, networking and educational opportunities, and so much more! There is always something to do here. Stop by, **every Wednesday at 9:15 PM in Gateway South 122**! Check out our website for more information: (https://ducklink.stevens.edu/scsc/home/).

This is the official SCSC GitHub Organization. Anybody is welcome (and encouraged) to join this GitHub Org! Please contact Jason Bhalla with any questions or issues.

_Note: SCSC had a previous GitHub account (https://github.com/StevensCSC). That account is retired, but remains public as an archive of previous projects. Starting January 2026, this GitHub Org is the only updated and official host for SCSC._
